# CLI Cheat Sheets

*Built for operators. Maintained in the open.*

This repository contains practical command-line cheat sheets for operators working in OpenShift, Kubernetes-adjacent environments, and regulated enterprise systems.

These cheat sheets are designed to be:

* **Quick reference** — easy to scan when you just need the command
* **Copy / paste friendly** — no ceremony, no fluff
* **Usable under pressure** — during incidents, exams, or live troubleshooting

They are intentionally concise and opinionated, favoring clarity over completeness.
